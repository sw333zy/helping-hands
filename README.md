A web application which allows users to find non-profit and government human services within Washington, D.C., 		My goal was to determine the services users need and allow them to find them on a map containing also containing 		relevant information to each  specific location. An API from the District of Columbiaâ€™s Open Data website was used to 		find a wide range of human services throughout the city. Filtering with JavaScript was used to determine pertinent 		information to the project while the Angular framework and MapBox library were used to place markers on locations 		with pop-up information for data visualization.
